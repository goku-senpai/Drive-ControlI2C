ESP-32 Standalone Version 
===========================
Paremeters are currently hardcoded in "/software/microcontroller/define.h"
sensor data is sent to external processing unit.

System Loop 
----------------------
- each valve type needs custom valve controller included histeresis 
- PID control for SMC valves
- a lucy controller which sets the targetpressures 
- trajectory which calcs new target pressure based on imu and sensor values 
- apply new dTargetPressures to controler ( underlying controller handles histereisis)
- send current values

----------------------



ESP-32 machine learning implemenation 
=======================================
implement machine learning model on the esp e.g with tensorflow lite.

System Loop 
----------------------
- use trained model on esp to calc new params.
- apply the params for next control step .
- send data back to pc .
- train model. 
- send new weights to esp
